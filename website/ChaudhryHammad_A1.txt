B. Translate the diagram to Relational Model in 3NF

  Book      (ISBN number, book title, author, publisher, edition, number of copies, history of borrowers)
  Member    (card number, full name, phone number, member since, books borrowed, borrow history, mailing address, region_id)
  Region    (region_id, zipcode, city, state, country, region name)
  Category  (name, description, number of books)
  Borrowed  (card number, book borrowed, card number, date borrowed, return date, due date)

C. Give one reasonable example of a recursive relationship, and draw the ER diagram for this situation. Explain briefly.
  -An example of a recursive relationship is the entity type history of borrowers in book and the entity type borrow history in member. These are practically the same
  entity types that participate in different roles. In book, it gives us the members who have borrowed this book in the past and in member, it gives us the books that
  the member has borrowed in the past.

D. Give one reasonable example of a relationship with a cardinality ratio *:* (many to many), and draw the ER diagram for this situation. Explain briefly.
  -An example of a relationship with a cardinality ratio is the member entity and borrowed entity. The member can borrow many books and can have a history of many borrowed
  books and the borrowed entity can have many members that borrow books from the library

E. Give one reasonable example of an entity set that has two disjoint subclasses with optional participation. Explain briefly.
